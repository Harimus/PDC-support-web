Glossary of terms
=================

Here, you will find the basic terminologies needed to get started with PDC. 

.. About basic HPC architecture

Like most high-performace computing facilities, PDC is mainly features **clusters** (currently, they are Beskow and Tegner). Each cluster has many individual computers calles **nodes**, that are analogous to the computers we use everyday. And each node in turn has, **processors** made up of actual computing entities calles **cores**. To get some perspective, Beskow consists of 1676 nodes with 32 cores per node, and Tegner has 65 nodes with 48/24 cores per node.
